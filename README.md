Overview

This project aims to analyze product reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in the text. Using various text preprocessing techniques and machine learning models, we achieve high accuracy in sentiment classification.

Technologies Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK
SpaCy
Transformers (for BERT)

Features

Text Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.
Lemmatization: Converting words to their base form.
Count Vectorization: Transforming text into a matrix of token counts.

Models Used:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Trees
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Model Evaluation: 

Performance metrics and accuracy assessment for each model, with BERT achieving an impressive accuracy of 95.53%.
